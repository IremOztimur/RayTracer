# RayTracer - A Pure Python Raytracer

RayTracer is a simple yet powerful ray tracing engine written entirely in Python. It allows you to render 3D scenes into 2D images using ray tracing techniques. 

## Features

- Pure Python implementation
- Supports basic materials and lighting
- Simple and extensible design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run RayTracer, you need to have Python installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/iremoztimur/RayTracer.git
    cd RayTracer
    ```

### Usage

To render a scene, you can use the provided Makefile commands:

- To clean up the project directory:

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

- To run the ray tracer:

    ```sh
    make run
    ```

- To open the generated image files:

    ```sh
    make open
    ```
